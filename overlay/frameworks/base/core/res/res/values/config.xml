         This value sets the floor for the darkest possible auto-brightness
         adjustment.  It is expected to be somewhat less than the first entry in
         config_autoBrightnessLcdBacklightValues so as to allow the user to have
         some range of adjustment to dim the screen further than usual in very
         dark rooms. The contents of the screen must still be clearly visible
         in darkness (although they may not be visible in a bright room). -->
